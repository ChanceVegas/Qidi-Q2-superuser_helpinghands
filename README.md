# What’s in this guide

This repo covers:

- Beginner‑friendly first‑time setup  
- Remote and mobile access options  
- Filament tracking with Spoolman  
- Faster, cleaner printer macros  
- One‑line install and uninstall tools

# Chapter 0 – True Beginners

If this is your first 3D printer (or your first Klipper printer), start here.  
This section walks you through slicer setup, basic usage, and the “what do I do first?” questions.

# Chapter 1 – Plugins

## Remote Access

I used to recommend OctoEverywhere, but recent reliability issues and aggressive paywalling make it hard to suggest now.

I’m moving toward Tailscale‑based remote access. Once I’ve fully tested it on the Q2, I’ll publish a full guide.

Alternatives worth considering: **Obico**

## Mobile Access

I use **OctoApp**, which works well on both iOS and Android.

Alternative: **Mobilraker**

# Filament Tracking

I use **Spoolman** for filament tracking.  
This becomes especially useful once Bunny Box is installed on the Qidi Box.

# All-in-One Installer (AIO)

The AIO is a single ANSI-colored bash menu that handles every supported install and uninstall path for the Q2 — no need to remember which `.sh` to run for which variant.

SSH into the Q2 as `mks`, then run:

```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChanceVegas/Qidi-Q2-superuser_helpinghands/refs/heads/main/All_in_One_Installer/aio_menu.sh | bash
```

# Printer Configs

The Q2 ships with a very heavy PRINT_START macro and a lot of vendor‑specific glue code.  
This repo documents what those macros do and provides faster, cleaner replacements.

All macro adjustments are handled by the AIO installer above. For reference configs and additional resources:

# Printables

Once your Q2 is running smoothly, here are prints that actually improve the machine.

# You’re Done

Congratulations — you’ve reached the end of the guide.

If you have ideas, corrections, or additional tips for the Q2, feel free to open an issue or PR.  
I’m always improving this setup and appreciate good suggestions.
