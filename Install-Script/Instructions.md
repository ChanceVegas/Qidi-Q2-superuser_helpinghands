## Whole 9 Yards Install

**Installs:** Bunny Box + HelixScreen + my custom config changes  
This is the full setup I run on my own Q2.

**Compatibility** Q2 with Qid Box, doesn't work with non-qidi box printers. 

### Pros

- **Bunny Box** adds improved box functionality, faster loading, and better multicolor behavior.  
  [Bunny Box Documentation](https://github.com/Wazzup77/Bunny-Box)
- **HelixScreen** replaces the stock UI and works seamlessly with Bunny Box.  
  [Helixscreen Documentation](https://github.com/prestonbrown/helixscreen) 
- Ships with a preconfigured screen layout.

### Cons

- Bunny Box currently requires HelixScreen.  
- HelixScreen is working on stock screen support, but it’s not ready yet.

### Install command

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Camden-Winder/Qidi-Q2-superuser/refs/heads/main/Install-Script/BunnyBox%26HelixScreen.sh | sh
```

After installation, download and import the Orca slicer presets:

## Just Faster

**Installs:** Only the macro and config improvements  

**Compatibility** Q2's without the box, doesn't work on printers with the box.

This is for users who want to keep the stock screen and avoid modifying (or don't have) the Qidi Box.  
It’s the clean OEM+ setup — faster starts, cleaner macros, nothing extra.

### Pros

- Keeps the stock screen  
- Faster PRINT_START  
- Cleaner macros  
- No UI changes  
- No Bunny Box or HelixScreen required

### Cons

- You don’t get Bunny Box  
- You don’t get HelixScreen

### Install command

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Camden-Winder/Qidi-Q2-superuser/refs/heads/main/Install-Script/JustFasterPrinter.sh | sh
```

## Uninstall and Revert

If you want to remove everything and go back to your previous configuration, you can run the uninstaller.

This removes:

- Bunny Box  
- HelixScreen  
- All applied config changes  
- And restores your backed‑up configs (if available)

### Uninstall command

```sh
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Camden-Winder/Qidi-Q2-superuser/refs/heads/main/Install-Script/uninstall.sh | sh
```

## Notes

- All scripts are designed for the Qidi Q2’s default user (`mks`).  
- Do **not** run these scripts as root — it will break permissions.  
- Backups are stored in your `printer_data/config` directory and `/home/mks/mudstockbackups`.  
- More variants will be added as the project evolves.
