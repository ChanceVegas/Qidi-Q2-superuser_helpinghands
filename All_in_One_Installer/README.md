## Requirements

- Qidi Q2 running stock Klipper firmware
- SSH access as user `mks` (the default Qidi user)
- Internet access from the printer
- **Do not run as root** — the script will refuse to start

## Install

SSH into the Q2 as `mks`, then:

**One-liner:**
```bash
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChanceVegas/Qidi-Q2-superuser_helpinghands/refs/heads/main/All_in_One_Installer/aio_menu.sh | bash
```

**Download first (review before running):**
```bash
curl -fsSL -o aio_menu.sh \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ChanceVegas/Qidi-Q2-superuser_helpinghands/refs/heads/main/All_in_One_Installer/aio_menu.sh
chmod +x aio_menu.sh
./aio_menu.sh
```

## Menu options

| # | Option | What it does |
|---|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Install BunnyBox & HelixScreen** | For Q2 owners with a Qidi Box. Installs Happy Hare MMU firmware and the HelixScreen touchscreen UI, applies optimised Klipper configs, and enables filament drying with automatic spool rotation. Option 1 automatically installs the Happier Hare patched HelixScreen build when `/home/mks/helixscreen-pi-happier-hare.zip` is present or `HAPPIER_HARE_ZIP_URL` is set; macro buttons remain the fallback. |
| 2 | **Install KlipperScreen** | Installs KlipperScreen Happy Hare Edition — a touchscreen UI built specifically for Happy Hare MMU setups. Configures 4-gate support for the Qidi Box. Does not install BunnyBox or modify Klipper configs. |
| 3 | **Install Just Faster Printer** | For Q2 owners without a Box. Keeps the stock Qidi screen but adds cleaner macros, faster print start, and adaptive bed meshing. |
| 4 | **Revert to Backup** | Fully uninstalls everything AIO has installed and restores your printer to the state it was in before the first AIO run. Runs a health check automatically at the end. |
| 5 | **Idle Fan Shutdown** | Addon toggle. Shuts off fans and heaters after 10 minutes idle, but only once all temps have dropped to safe levels. |
| 6 | **Mainsail** | Addon toggle. Installs the Mainsail web interface, accessible at `http://<printer-ip>:100`. Qidi's stock UI on port 80 is unaffected. Includes a camera proxy so the webcam stream works in Mainsail. |
| 7 | **About** | Shows the current AIO version and a brief description. |
| 8 | **Health Check / Run Verifiers** | Scans your Klipper config for common problems — duplicate macros, broken include lines, invalid settings — and offers to fix each one. Safe to run any time. |

## Backup and revert behavior

Option 1 captures the current `/home/mks/printer_data/config` state before it installs BunnyBox, Happy Hare, HelixScreen, Happier Hare, or AIO config files. The first clean snapshot is preserved as the stock baseline and includes `/home/mks/printer_data/config/KAMP` when that directory exists.

Option 4 (**Revert to Backup**) prefers that first stock snapshot, restores it over the active Klipper config directory, removes AIO-installed runtime directories and residue, and verifies stock display services. Root-level AIO KAMP files such as `KAMP_Settings.cfg`, `Adaptive_Meshing.cfg`, `Line_Purge.cfg`, and `Smart_Park.cfg` are treated as install artifacts; the stock `KAMP/` directory is preserved through backup/restore instead of being blindly removed.

## Filament drying (BunnyBox installs only)

After installing BunnyBox (option 1), the following one-tap drying macros are available from the touchscreen or the Klipper console. Spools rotate automatically throughout each cycle.

| Macro | Temp | Time |
|---|---|---|
| `DRY_PLA` | 45 °C | 4 h |
| `DRY_PETG` | 65 °C | 4 h |
| `DRY_ABS` | 65 °C | 4 h |
| `DRY_TPU` | 55 °C | 4 h |
| `DRY_PA` | 70 °C | 8 h |

## After installing BunnyBox & HelixScreen (option 1)

1. Run `FIRMWARE_RESTART` from the Klipper console or HelixScreen.
2. Run `sudo reboot` over SSH.
3. Run **option 8 (Health Check)** to verify everything loaded correctly.
4. **First-time only:** calibrate the MMU gear steppers:
   ```
   MMU_CALIBRATE_GEAR GATE=0 LENGTH=100
   ```
   Mark the filament at the entry point, measure how far it moved, then re-run with `MEASURED=<mm>`. Repeat for each gate.
5. Load filament into each gate and start a drying preset from the HelixScreen AMS environment UI when using the Happier Hare patched zip, or from the macro buttons/console as a fallback.

## After installing KlipperScreen (option 2)

1. Run `FIRMWARE_RESTART` from the Klipper console or KlipperScreen.
2. Run `sudo reboot` over SSH.
3. Verify KlipperScreen is running: `systemctl status KlipperScreen`

## After installing Just Faster Printer (option 3)

1. Run `FIRMWARE_RESTART`.
2. Run `sudo reboot` over SSH.
3. Run a bed level and `SCREWS_TILT_CALCULATE` before your first print.

## Release history

| Version | Notable additions |
|---------|------------------|
| RC2.17 | Updates the validated HelixScreen pin to `v0.99.71` and adds a guarded upstream-release monitor plus local prepare script for future HelixScreen upgrades |
| RC2.16 | Makes option 8's duplicate-macro verifier follow the active `printer.cfg` include graph, so stock `KAMP/` files preserved for Revert to Backup are not mistaken for active duplicate macros |
| RC2.15 | Adds BunnyBox's live `aht10 box1_env` humidity path to the Happier Hare HelixScreen patch, points Option 1 at the updated patched archive, and reports live Qidi Box temperature, humidity, heater target, and heater power in option 8 |
| RC2.14 | Preserves stock `/home/mks/printer_data/config/KAMP` during Revert to Backup: Option 1 backs it up with the config snapshot, cleanup no longer blindly deletes it after restore, and Revert verifies it returned when present in the selected backup |
| RC2.13 | Points Option 1 at the hosted Happier Hare patched HelixScreen release asset (`happier-hare-rc2.12/helixscreen-pi.zip`) so installs no longer require SCP when the release asset is available |
| RC2.12 | Option 1 now automatically installs the Happier Hare patched HelixScreen archive from `/home/mks/helixscreen-pi-happier-hare.zip` when present, without requiring `HAPPIER_HARE_ZIP_URL` |
| RC2.11 | Hardened Happier Hare install verification so it scans all installed `helix-screen*` binaries and reports which binary contains the dryer and Qidi Box sensor patches |
| RC2.10 | Updated Happier Hare Qidi Box sensor matching for the Happy Hare config names (`temperature_sensor box1_env`, `heater_generic box1_heater`) and made install/revert instructions explicitly require `FIRMWARE_RESTART` followed by `sudo reboot` |
| RC2.9 | Hardened Revert to Backup stock display restoration: resets failed lightdm/makerbase state, restores `graphical.target`, unmasks `display-manager.service`, prints recent service logs if the stock display stack does not come back, and keeps `/home/mks/mudstockbackups/` when stock display verification fails |
| RC1.30 | Option 2 (KlipperScreen) temporarily disabled — display not rendering despite service running; under investigation |
| RC1.29 | Fixed KlipperScreen Xorg crash: Q2 kernel lacks `/dev/tty0` (no VT subsystem); systemd drop-in now creates the device node via `ExecStartPre` before each service start and clears the `ConditionPathExists` gate |
| RC1.28 | Fixed KlipperScreen not launching: upstream service unit has `ConditionPathExists=/dev/tty0` which fails on the Q2; a systemd drop-in now clears this condition after install |
| RC1.27 | Option 2 is now standalone KlipperScreen — no longer bundles BunnyBox, config templates, KAMP, or drying macros; `_install_bunnybox()` simplified to HelixScreen-only |
| RC1.26 | KlipperScreen option 2 rewritten to use upstream `KlipperScreen-install.sh` as-is (stops fighting lightdm/tty0); `makerbase-client` and `helixscreen` are masked before the upstream installer runs; removed all custom X/lightdm manipulation; `xserver-xorg-legacy` stripped from install script (not available on Debian Bullseye ARM) |
| RC1.25 | Fixed `install_ks.sh` aborting on `git describe` — switched from shallow clone (`--depth 1`) to full clone so tag history is available; fixed service starting before custom `launch_KlipperScreen.sh` is in place by changing `START=1` → `START=0` in KlipperScreen-install.sh invocation |
| RC1.24 | Fixed KlipperScreen service crash (`Group=mks` — Q2 has no `mks` group); fixed wrong KlipperScreen clone (existing non-HH-Edition clone is now detected and replaced); fixed `daemon-reload` ordering so the service unit is loaded before `enable`/`start` |
| RC1.23 | KlipperScreen option 2 rewritten: uses KlipperScreen Happy Hare Edition as an X client on lightdm's `:0` display (no xinit, no tty switching, no network changes); `NETWORK=N` to prevent the installer from killing dhcpcd/NetworkManager; 4-gate Qidi Box support via `install_ks.sh -g 4`; clean revert restores lightdm config and stock display |
| RC1.22 | Removed KlipperScreen option (Q2 display constraints made it unreliable); added filament drying macro buttons (Dry PLA/PETG/ABS/TPU/Nylon, Stop Dry) to HelixScreen settings; menu renumbered to 7 options |
| RC1.14 | Adopted `RC<major>.<minor>` version format; fixed duplicate webcam entries in Mainsail |
| RC13 | Fixed camera stream in Mainsail (nginx `/webcam/` proxy + correct ustreamer paths) |
| RC11 | Fixed two post-install Klipper errors: `gcode: not valid in section 'bed_mesh'` and `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE already registered`; install now aborts correctly if a required step fails |
| RC10 | Fixed fresh-install black screen — HelixScreen now activates correctly after option 1 |
| RC9 | Automatic spool rotation during filament drying cycles |
| RC8 | Health check runs automatically after every Revert to Backup; new config validators (orphan includes, invalid settings, leftover MMU files) |
| RC7 | Mainsail web UI as a menu addon |
| RC6 | Fixed `BED_MESH_CALIBRATE` duplicate crash from older BunnyBox installs |
| RC5 | Fixed Klipper startup crash caused by conflicting Box hardware drivers |
| RC4 | Simplified uninstall — Revert to Backup is now the single restore path |
| RC1–3 | Initial AIO release; HelixScreen + BunnyBox install/uninstall; idle fan shutdown addon |

## Known limitations

- **Native Qidi Box humidity/dryer UI requires the Happier Hare patched HelixScreen zip.** Without that zip, use the macro buttons or Klipper console.
- **MMU gear calibration is required after a fresh install.**
- **Camera streaming (Mainsail)** requires a USB camera connected to the printer.

## Troubleshooting

**`ERROR: Cannot reach raw.githubusercontent.com`** — No internet from the printer. Check network settings.

**`ERROR: Config directory not found`** — Not running as `mks`, or this isn't a Klipper-based Q2.

**Klipper won't start after install** — Run option 8 (Health Check). It will identify and offer to fix the most common causes.

**KlipperScreen not showing on display** — Check `sudo journalctl -u KlipperScreen -n 50`. Verify lightdm is running (`systemctl status lightdm`) and that `display-setup-script` is set in `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf`.

**Klipper won't start after uninstall** — Use option 4 (Revert to Backup) for a clean restore.

**LightDM fails after Revert to Backup** — Run option 8 (Health Check) or inspect `journalctl -u lightdm -n 80 --no-pager` and `journalctl -u makerbase-client -n 80 --no-pager`. RC2.9+ prints recent stock-display service logs during revert when either service fails.

**No stock backup exists** — `/home/mks/mudstockbackups/` is created automatically on first run. If configs were already changed before the first AIO run, restore from a Qidi factory image first, then run AIO to capture a clean baseline.
